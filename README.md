# Meepo (Meepo-OpenEthereum)

Meepo implementation on OpenEthereum.

This is an implmentation based on the paper in ICDE 2020:
[P. Zheng, Q. Xu, Z. Zheng, Z. Zhou, Y. Yan and H. Zhang, "Meepo: Sharded Consortium Blockchain," 2021 IEEE 37th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), 2021, pp. 1847-1852, doi: 10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00165.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9458713)

Since Meepo-Geth (Golang) is unable to be open-source thanks to the copyright, our community provides another implementation (Rust) based on the published paper.

This version is still working in progress.
